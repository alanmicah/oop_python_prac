# Constructors

# Constructors are special functions that are executed when an object is instantiated.
# In Python, the __init__() function is used as the constructor and is called when creating an object.

# The self parameter in the __init__() method refers to the current instance
# and the instance variable course allows for input to assign a value

# Destructors

# Destructors are special functions that are called when an object gets deleted. 
# In Python, the __del__() method is commonly used as the destructor and is called when an object is deleted.

# Pythonâ€™s built-in __del__() method represents the destructor in a class.
